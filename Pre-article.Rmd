To understand the underlying factors that either facilitate or impede the previously 
observed changed in sapling recruitment patterns, we modeled the impact of three 
key environmental characteristics on the sapling distribution and abundance. 
Specifically, we examined the influence of biotic factors (presence of conspecific 
species and total basal area), soil specificity (pH of humus and thickness of organic 
matter), and climatic conditions (moisture and temperature).

Our findings indicate that biotic characteristics exert a strong and significant 
effect on both the presence and abundance of tree species. The presence of 
conspecific species had a significant and positive correlation with the presence of 
saplings in the understory, ranging from 1.8 to 7.6 (Figure 3). This effect was 
consistently observed across all species examined. Moreover, the presence of 
conspecific species also positively influenced the number of saplings. Conversely, 
total basal area exhibited predominantly 
negative correlations with both presence and abundance. This negative influence was 
particularly pronounced for pioneer species as well as P. mariana and A. rubrum. 
However, A. balsamea displayed an interesting exception, with its presence positively 
correlated with basal area, while its abundance showed a negative correlation. 

Regarding soil characteristics, pH was found to be positively correlated only 
with P. tremuloides presence.
thickness of organic matter negatiely correlated with presence of pionneer and temperate species.
(i.e.Temperate species and pionneer exhibited a higher probability of presence on thinner soil.)

Finally, amoingst our two climatic variables (CMI and temperature) Temperature 
was found to have a significantly strong positive effect on the presence of temperate saplings.

disturbance_nb <- readRDS("output/disturbance_nb.rds")
```

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10, warning= FALSE}
# Plot the results
disturbance_plot(disturbance_pa, 3)
```

** NOTE **

General trend per species
- Acer rubrum sees an increase in presence probability with disturbance

Trend for cuts :
- Clearcut : very positove effect on pionneer species especially P. tremuloides
- Protecting regeneration doesn't seem to have a strong "intended" effect on the presence 
probability of species but for Acer rubrum
- Partial cut : positive effect on temperate species (8 species*time interval out of nine) 
but also for P. tremuloides and A.balsamea only on the short term : 10 and 20 years

Trend for fire and outbreak :
- our temperate Acer sac and B all do not show a concistent effect after an outbreak but negative after fire
- A. Balsamea is very present after outbreak, the other temperate species also 
show a significant but less important increase after 10 years
- fire not that much noticeable effect

ON the other trend we could discuss (time)
- there is change over time after a disturbance 
(i.e. A. balsamea after a fire, P. tremuloide after a cut and fire)

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10, warning= FALSE}
# Plot the results
disturbance_plot(disturbance_nb, 3)
```

Partial cut :
- Temperate species also increase their sapling density after partial cut

Regeneration protection :
- positive for the number of new sappling (if not for the presence probability) 
especially for B. all and Acer species in the first 10 years

outbreak and A balsamea :
- More present but also more numerous

# Paragraphe from my report slightly adapted

Firstly, it is important to note that different disturbances have varying effects 
on sapling recruitment. While they all fall within a similar range of importance, 
their impact on different species can vary. For instance, the presence of B. papyrifera 
saplings is significantly influenced by clearcut and fire, but not by partial cut or 
outbreaks (Fig. 4e,m,u). Generally, clearcut has a positive effect on the presence 
of pioneer species such as P. tremuloides, B. papyrifer (Fig. 4d,e). 
The effect of CPRS, in terms of presence probability, is not significantly 
positive compared to clearcut as we could have anticipated. Only Acer rubrum 
seems to be more present on this disturbed plots. However, it does lead to significantly higher 
sapling abundance for A. saccharum in the first 10 years and B. alleghaniensis in the first 20 (Fig. 5b,c).

Among the temperate species, only A. rubrum is affected by outbreak events in a consistent way. 
It is more frequently observed in plots 20 years after an outbreak, although 
its abundance is lower compared to undisturbed plots (Fig4i, 5i ). Generally A. rubrum is
more present in disturbed plots, whatever the event.

After 50 years effect of fire can still be detected in the regenerative layer 
and even if it is not in the same time frame as cut and outbreak effect are similar in amplitude.
No species is significantly and consistently more present 50 to 100 years after 
a fire but A. rubrum compared to an undisturbed plot.
